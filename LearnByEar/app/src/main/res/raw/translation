Barra Barra (Out! Out!) = bb Sadness, hate and the reign of arbitrary
bb Destruction, jealousy ; there is no trust left
bb Thirst and people are unlucky
bb No honour, but oppression and slavery
bb Rivers were dried up and seas have ruined everything
bb Stars are switched off and the sun went down
bb There are no trees left and the birds stopped singing
bb There are neither days, nor nights left, darkness only
bb Hell ; there is no beauty left
2.bb Time has increased, there is no honour left
bb Ruin and war and the blood is flowing
bb There are only walls left, walls standing up
bb Fear and people remain silent
bb Sadness, hate and the reign of arbitrary
bb Destruction and jealousy ; there is no trust left
bb Rivers were dried up and seas have ruined everything
bb stars are switched off and the sun went down
barra barra (in a low voice, plus crescendo)
3.bb There is neither good, nor happiness, nor luck anymore
bb There are no trees left; the birds stopped singing
bb There are neither nights, nor days left; darkness only
bb Desolation, hell, there is no beauty left
bb Time has increased, there is no honour left
bb Ruin and war and the blood is flowing
bb There are only walls left, walls standing up
bb Sadness, hate and the reign of arbitrary
bb Destruction and jealousy ; there is no trust left.
